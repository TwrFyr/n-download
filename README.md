# NOTICE
`n-download` has been discontinued, since I am currently working on a better version. The current release version is broken, because the html structure of [nhentai](https://nhentai.net/) changed. Check out the new project [n-hen.py](https://github.com/TwrFyr/n-hen.py).

# n-download

## What is n-download

n-download is a small windows console application for downloading doujins from the website [nhentai.net](https://nhentai.net/) fast and easy.

## Features

* download doujins fast and easy by entering the corresponing number
* possibility to change saving directory
* 'help'-command for additional information

## How to use

1. Go to [nhentai.net](https://nhentai.net/) and search for the doujin you want to download.
2. Copy the number from the link of the entry (e.g. you want to download the doujin with the url https://nhentai.net/g/144725/, you would enter '144725').
3. You will be shown basic information for making sure it is the right one. Confirm the entry by typing 'y'.
4. Wait for the program to download. Done.

If you want to know more about how it works, try the 'help'-command.

## How to 'install'
In order to user n-download you will need Java 8 or a newer version. You can do so [here]( https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Download the [n-download.zip](https://github.com/TwrFyr/n-downloader/releases/tag/v1.0.0) file and extract it to wherever you want. Use the start.bat or your preferred shell to start the jar. The basic command is `java -jar n-download.jar`. 

(Since it is a console application you won't be able to start n-download by double-clicking the executable .jar.)
